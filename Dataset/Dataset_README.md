`MutaPheno_FeatureAnnotations_16Datasets.xlsx`:   
This file provides feature annotations for 16 mutation datasets, each stored in a separate sheet. For each mutation in these datasets, a total of 34 features are annotated, organized into three categories: residue-level (21 features), mutation-level (8 features), and protein-level (5 features).  
The **residue-level features** include: Core, Surface, Helix, Sheet, Loop, PTM, PTM-4Å, PTM-8Å, AlloSite, PPI-BS, PLI-BS, PNI-BS, IDReg, SLiM, DomReg, Aliphatic, Aromatic, PosCharge, NegCharge, Neutral, and Special. All of these are categorical features. For each mutation, a value of ‘yes’ indicates that it occurs within the corresponding annotated region; ‘no’ indicates that it does not; and ‘NONE’ signifies that the mutated protein's sequence or structure lacks any region of that type.  
The **mutation-level features** include: Six discrete and two continuous features. The six discrete features are Charge-0, Charge-1, Charge-2, Size-0, Size-1, and Size-2, which reflect physicochemical changes caused by mutations. A value of 'yes' means the mutation fits the condition defined by the feature, while 'no' means it does not. The two continuous features are Stability change (∆∆G<sub>fold</sub>) and Binding affinity change (∆∆G<sub>bind</sub>), which are numerical values predicted by PremPS and MutaBind2, respectively. If no prediction is available, the value is recorded as 'NONE'.  
The **protein-level features** include: Specific domain, Functional class, Subcellular location, Cancer signaling pathway, and KEGG pathway. The Specific domain feature indicates which domain types the mutation falls into. If the mutation matches one or more specific domain types, the matched terms are separated by '|'; if none, the value is 'NONE'. The other four features describe the corresponding categories of the mutation's host protein, such as its functional class, subcellular location, and pathway membership. Similarly, multiple matches are separated by '|', and 'NONE' denotes no match.
